## Why did I make a chess application?
I've made a chess application to learn something about typescript and using more opensourced projects for my own projects.<br>
And to learn something about making algorythms and using your code wisely for making the paths for each and every chess piece with optimizations.<br>

### What are the functionalities?

## Difficulties during development

When creating the application I ran into the issue of making the moves eventually ive just made it with forloops that reachout to the top of the board and then stop if it sees a pawn that it cant mate it.<br>
The autocheckmate hasn't been implemented because I've been working on Entitled Engine 2 since I've finished the bare minimum of how chess works.<br>
